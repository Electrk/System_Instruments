<font:Arial Bold:32>Phrase Textbox<font:Arial:16>

<bitmap:Add-Ons/System_Instruments/client/images/tutorial/pianoPanel05.png>





The most essential part of the GUI: the phrase textbox.  As you have probably noticed, this section does not go away when you change panels.

This is where all the notes, rests, etc. will go.  The numbers in the top left corner show you how many characters you have left in the phrase.

The <font:Arial Bold:16>Preview<font:Arial:16> button plays the phrase to you so only you will be able to hear it.

The <font:Arial Bold:16>Clear<font:Arial:16> button clears the phrase (no shit)

The <font:Arial Bold:16>Copy to Clipboard<font:Arial:16> button copies the phrase to your clipboard (wow!!)

The <font:Arial Bold:16>Play<font:Arial:16> button plays the phrase out loud, but only if you are holding the correct instrument.
