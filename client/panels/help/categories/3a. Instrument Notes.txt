The top section of the "Piano" panel is all about adding notes to your phrase.

The literal piano is for melodic instruments such as the guitar, harp, and... well, the piano.

When you click on a key, the note will be added to your phrase if <font:Arial Bold:16>Add to Phrase<font:Arial:16> is checked.  If you right click on a key, it will add a + at the end for chords.

If <font:Arial Bold:16>Play Live<font:Arial:16> is checked, and you are holding the correct instrument, the note will be played out loud.  Otherwise, the note will be played only to you.

If the currently-selected instrument has any non-melodic notes, you can select them from the list on the right.  This is usually only for drums, but other instruments have them too.
