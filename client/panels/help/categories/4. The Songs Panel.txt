This is where song creation takes place.  A <font:Arial Bold:16>song<font:Arial:16> is a series of phrases arranged in whatever way you want.

On the left is where you set the phrases you want to use in a song.  You can have up to CONST_MAX_SONG_PHRASES unique phrases per song.

On the right is where you choose what order the song phrases will be played in.  They can be in any order you want, repeated however many times you want, up until the hard limit of CONST_SONG_ORDER_LIMIT phrases.
